# Logger

This is a tiny Mac OS X application written in MacRuby that displays logs generated in iOS applications with the NetworkLogger which is part of [motion-support](http://github.com/tkadauke/motion-support). Logging in this way highly improves the output for RubyMotion specs, since the spec output is not mixed with the logger output.

# Requirements

To compile, you need a recent version of XCode (from the App Store) as well as [MacRuby](http://www.macruby.org) installed.

# Installation

Either run the application from XCode or archive it once and then copy the built application from within the archive into your Applications folder.
